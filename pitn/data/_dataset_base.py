        """Dataset of (optionally filtered) patches of an N-dim Tensor.

        The behavior of patch filtering is expressive, but slightly convoluted.

        If given, the 'patch_select_fn' will be called with two positional parameters,
        the 'source_im' patches and the indices of those patches. The remaining args
        will be keyword only, coming from the 'meta_vals' argument. All keys in
        'meta_keys_to_patch_index' will be passed as patches with the same indices as
        the 'source_im' patches. This way, both positional information (such as a
        segmentation mask that corresponds to the im patches) and global metadata (such
        as 'subject_id') can be used in the patch filtering.

        Iterative patch filtering can be slow, so patches are processed as batches of
        patches (swatches) to reduce time in the python loop (equivalent to setting
        the batch size to 1). At the same time, this does not require as much memory as
        processing all patches at once (setting batch size to infinite).

        *NOTE* The tensors provided may not be contiguous in memory! This saves time
        and memory when providing the patches. If a tensor must be contiguous in order
        to select the patch(es), call `t.contiguous()` or another operation that ensures
        a contiguous layout.

        Some code taken from the `monai.data.Dataset` class, see
        <https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/_modules/monai/data/dataset.html#Dataset>.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source_im : torch.Tensor
            Primary Tensor from which patches will be sampled.

            Must be shape [C x (spatial_dim_1, spatial_dim_2, ...)].
        patch_shape : tuple

        stride : int, optional
            by default 1
        patch_select_fn : Optional[ Callable[[torch.Tensor, Tuple[torch.Tensor]], torch.Tensor] ], optional
            Function to select valid patches, by default None

            This function should have the following signature:
            fn(patches: torch.Tensor, start_idx: Tuple[torch.Tensor], other_keyword_arg1, other_keyword_arg2, ..., **kwargs)
                -> torch.BoolTensor

            The 'patches' and 'start_idx' fields will be called by position. All other
            arguments will be called by keyword. Other keyword arguments may be used
            (outside of **kwargs) so long as the function uses '**kwargs' to accept any
            number of keyword args.

            Additional kwargs are given according to the 'meta_vals' argument.

        transform : optional
            by default None
        meta_keys_to_patch_index : Sequence[str], optional
            Sequence of keys in 'meta_vals' to be indexed by patches, by default set()

            Values in 'meta_vals' that have keys in 'meta_keys_to_patch_index' are
            assumed to be Tensors with the same number of dimensions as 'source_im' and
            the same spatial dimension size(s). Batch and channel size may be different,
            but must exist with at least size 1.

            Each Tensor indexed by these keys will be indexed with patches in an
            equivalent manner to the original 'source_im'. I.e., swatches of patches
            will index into the spatial dimensions of each indicated Tensor. The
            source_im key is implicit, and will be keyed with 'im'.

            When a patch filtering function is used, the patches of each selected
            Tensor will be passed to the function with the key's name.
